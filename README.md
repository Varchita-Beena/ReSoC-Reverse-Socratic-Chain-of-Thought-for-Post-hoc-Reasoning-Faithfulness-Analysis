# ReSoC-Reverse-Socratic-Chain-of-Thought-for-Post-hoc-Reasoning-Faithfulness-Analysis
ReSoC (Reverse Socratic Chain-of-Thought) is a novel post-hoc test for rationale faithfulness. Instead of perturbing reasoning steps, ReSoC reverses the process: given a rationale, it attempts to regenerate the original question and re-answer it. A rationale is treated as faithful if the regenerated question recovers the ground-truth answer.

Refer to "ReSoC_Reverse Socratic Chain-of-Thought for Post-hoc Reasoning Faithfulness Analysis.pdf" to understand the process in depth.
